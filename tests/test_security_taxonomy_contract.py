"""Contract test: every taxonomy authority string exists in the live inventory.

The dangerous-authority taxonomy in `dhis2w_security.core.authorities`
hardcodes authority names. A name the running DHIS2 version does not define
can never be granted by current-version role editing and most likely gates
nothing -- matching on it gives false confidence. This test pins every
taxonomy string to the live `/api/authorities` inventory on the play
instances for v41, v42 and v43, minus the strings a major is known not to
define (`ABSENT_BY_VERSION`), each of which carries the live evidence.

Whether `/api/authorities` answers at all is a property of the
deployment, not of the major: some instances answer 500 on that route
while another instance on the identical revision answers 200 (BUGS.md
#45). A 500 therefore skips with a message naming that entry rather
than failing the run.

Marked `@pytest.mark.contract` so it runs in the dedicated CI job
(`.github/workflows/contract.yml`) and not as part of `make test`. Play
being unreachable or down (gateway 502/503/504) skips rather than fails.
